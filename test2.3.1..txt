1️⃣ Device Configuration (GPU Acceleration)
Before modification (the original AI version may not support GPU):
# no device specified
After modification:
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
print("Using device:", device)
# Move z, zs, ns to GPU
z, zs, ns = z.to(device), zs.to(device), ns.to(device)
✅ Purpose: Ensure the tensors are computed on the GPU to speed up rendering.
2️⃣ Tensor Type and Initialization
Before modification:
ns = torch.zeros_like(z)
After modification:
ns = torch.zeros_like(z, dtype=torch.int32)
✅ Purpose: Make sure the counter is of integer type to avoid type mismatch.
3️⃣ Batch Iteration Logic Optimization
Before modification (classic Python loop version might iterate over each pixel):
for pixel in grid:
    ...
After modification (batch computation with tensors):
for i in range(max_iter):
    zs_ = zs * zs + z
    not_diverged = torch.abs(zs_) < 4.0
    ns += not_diverged
    zs = zs_
✅ Purpose: Use a tensor mask to compute the whole image at once, avoiding slow Python loops.
4️⃣ Color Mapping and Plotting
Before modification:
# NumPy version, direct manipulation
After modification:
img = processFractal(ns.cpu().numpy())
plt.imshow(img)
plt.axis("off")
plt.tight_layout(pad=0)
plt.savefig("mandelbrot_gpu.png", dpi=300, bbox_inches="tight")
✅ Purpose:
.cpu().numpy() moves the GPU tensor back to CPU so Matplotlib can display it
Save the image as mandelbrot_gpu.png
dpi ensures high resolution
5️⃣ Minor Optimizations
max_iter is defined as a separate variable for easier adjustment of iteration count
not_diverged logic stays as a GPU batch operation, reducing Python-level loops
Summary:
Key modifications: .to(device) for GPU, integer type ns, batch iteration mask, .cpu().numpy() for plotting
Purpose: Ensure the Mandelbrot set renders quickly on GPU and can be directly visualized and saved.
